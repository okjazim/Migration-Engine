# Migration-Engine (Work in Progress)

This project is a command-line tool that safely migrates legacy CSV data into a PostgreSQL database. It includes a full ETL pipeline to extract, validate, transform, and load data while handling duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formats. The tool supports logging, error tracking, and rollback, making it safe to run multiple times without duplicating data. Designed for enterprise workflows, it ensures data integrity and reliability, demonstrating real-world engineering practices in handling messy legacy data.
